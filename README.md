### Featured Projects

**🔬 Cancer Subtype Classification**  
Developed a machine learning pipeline to classify cancer patients into three molecular subtypes using high-dimensional gene expression data (~12,000 genes). Applied feature selection and dimensionality reduction to identify key genes driving subtype differences, improving interpretability and model accuracy.

**📈 US Economic Confidence Modeling**  
Built a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model using quarterly U.S. macroeconomic indicators—including GDP growth, unemployment rate, and core CPI—to forecast the one-year investor confidence index. Conducted time-series analysis and impulse response interpretation to evaluate dynamic economic relationships.
