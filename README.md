### Welcome to Liam Wall's repositories...

I am Applied Mathematics Specialist at the University of Toronto. I love to work with math and statistics to solve any problem you can throw at me. In particular I am passionate about the applications that high-level thinking combined with a strong background in mathematics can bring to the future of AI and machine learning.
